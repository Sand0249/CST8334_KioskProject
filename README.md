# CST8334_KioskProject


It is Kiosk project in which kiosk is configured to perform different operations within college hall for the use of students and professors. 3 users can use the kiosk that are Administrator, Professors and Students. 
This application is developed for many important purposes such as:
- Professors can add their timetable using USB drive.
- Now they don’t need to specially use their laptops or their email account to put a notice for class cancellation to students. They can put these types of important notifications using this kiosk.
-	Same for students, they don’t need to open their email account for requesting appointment with professor. They can simply go to kiosk and take advantage of book an appointment facility.
-	Students can simply open their account on kiosk and check their own or any professor’s timetable.
-	If anybody is not familiar with rooms of Algonquin college (especially for new students), they can find the way to room using these kiosks.
